# Brainly â€“ Second Brain App

**Brainly** is a "second brain" app designed to help you capture, organize, and share your ideas, links, videos, images, and articlesâ€”all in one place. Inspired by the concept of a digital brain, this app lets you store and retrieve your knowledge, resources, and inspirations, so you never lose a great idea.
